# auto-sort
A kind of brutal automatic file sorter.
You might not want to use it. At least read the code first. I don't have alot of
media files on my computer, so I can exclude files by pattern pretty easily.
Regardless, this thing should make getting a handle on that runaway downloads
problem a little easier.
